# EDA-Yahoo-Finance-Stocks
Exploratory Data Analysis of selected tech stocks (Nvidia, Google, Microsoft, Meta) from January 1, 2025 to October 6, 2025 using Python, Pandas, Matplotlib and Seaborn. Analysis includes cumulative returns, outliers, correlations, autocorrelations, and visualizations.

Project Title:
Exploratory Data Analysis on Tech Stocks (NVIDIA, Google, Meta, Microsoft)

Description
This project performs an Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on daily stock data retrieved from Yahoo Finance.
It examines price behavior, volatility, cumulative returns, correlations, and autocorrelation patterns among four major technology companies: NVIDIA, Google, Meta, and Microsoft.

Objectives
Explore and visualize stock price dynamics.
Quantify correlations between stock returns and trading volumes.
Identify outliers and volatility periods.
Investigate short-term autocorrelation patterns using lag analysis.

Methodology
1)Data import and setup (automatically updated until the current date)
2)Data Inspection
3)Data Cleaning
4)Feature Engineering
5)Statistical Analysis
6)Visualization using Matplotlib and Seaborn
7)Conclusion

Key Insights (as of October 6, 2025)
NVIDIA yields the highest cumulative return (>30%).
Common outliers occurred across all stocks in April 2025.
The strongest return correlation is between Microsoft and Meta (0.68).
The strongest volume correlation is between Microsoft and Meta (0.78).
Mild autocorrelation observed at lag-2 (~0.11), and slight negative correlation at lag-3 (~ -0.12).
